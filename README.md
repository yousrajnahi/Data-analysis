# Data Analysis

## Introduction

This project provides an analysis data using R programming language. The main focus of the analysis is on classification and linear regression.

## Data

The dataset contains 16 quantitative variables and 60 observations. The variables in the dataset are described as follows:

* A1: Average annual precipitation in inches
* A2: Average January temperature in degrees Fahrenheit
* A3: Average July temperature in degrees Fahrenheit
* A4: Percentage of population in the SMSA (Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area) aged 65 or older in 1960
* A5: Household size in 1960
* A6: Education level of people over 22 years old
* A7: Households with complete kitchen
* A8: Population per square mile in urbanized areas
* A9: Percentage of non-white population
* A10: Percentage of office workers
* A11: Families with annual income less than $3,000
* A12: Relative hydrocarbon pollution potential
* A13: Relative nitrogen oxide pollution potential
* A14: Relative sulfur dioxide pollution
* A15: Average annual relative humidity percentage at 1pm
* B: Mortality rate



## Analysis

The analysis is divided into two main parts: classification and linear regression.

### Classification

In the classification section, the data is divided into two groups: those who have an ACM ACP certification and those who do not. The goal is to predict the likelihood of an individual having an ACM ACP certification based on their attributes.

### Linear Regression

In the linear regression section, the goal is to predict the income of an individual based on their attributes. A multiple linear regression model is used to accomplish this task.
